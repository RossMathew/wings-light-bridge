## Requirements

- Nodejs v10.2.1
- Truffle v4.1.8
- Ganache-cli v6.1.0

# Getting started

### 1. Clone repository

```
git clone -b cli https://github.com/wingsdao/wings-light-bridge.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### 3. Configure truffle.js

```
cp config.example.js config.js
```
Have a look at `config.example.js`, which is example of how `config.js` should look like and configure it for your needs (configure network parameters).

In `config.js` file make setup:
 - `rawPrivateKey` - put your raw private key (without `0x` prefix). It will be used during deploy of contracts and for signing transactions.
 - Set your web3 provider in `web3Provider` variable.
 - (optional) Set the `gasPrice` to the amount which you are most comfortable with.

### 4. Start cli

```
node index
```

## Deploy

You will be asked to enter:
 - token name (1-12 characters)
 - token symbol (3-5 characters)
 - token decimals

*NOTE: Save bridge contract address, you will need it later.*

## Forecasting

During forecasting period we need to transfer management of the `Bridge` contract to `DAO` contract.

You will be asked to enter:
 - `Bridge` contract address
 - `DAO` contract address

You can find `DAO` contract address from url.
To do it, just take URL of your project, like:

> https://wings.ai/project/0x28e7f296570498f1182cf148034e818df723798a

As you see - `0x28e7f296570498f1182cf148034e818df723798a`, it's your `DAO` contract address.

## Before crowdsale start

At this stage we need to start bridge.

You will be asked to enter:
 - `DAO` contract address

## Before crowdsale end

### Change token

Because during initial deploy `Default token` was used now we need to change it to the real one.

You will be asked to enter:
 - address of your real token contract

### Calculate rewards

You will be asked to enter:
 - total collected amount (ETH)
 - total sold amount (integer amount of tokens)
 - whether you are ready to transfer rewards or not (yes/no)

*NOTE: You have to have enough tokens and ETH for rewards on your balance before you make a transfer.*  
*NOTE: If you don't have enough tokens and/or ETH on your account please choose no, fund your account and repeat the process.*

**Important: Be careful because if you choose yes token and ETH reward amounts will immediately be transferred to `Bridge` contract.**

### Finish bridge

The final step is to finish the Bridge.

You will be asked to enter:
 - `Bridge` contract address

---

That's it. Bridge is finished.
